# Machine Learning in Octave/Matlab

A variety of ML algorithms from gradient descent to neural networks coded in Octave/Matlab with no fancy libraries. Everything including backpropagation of shallow neural network is coded with fundamental operations (+-*/) in Octave. This brought me into the ML rabbit hole and allowed me to gain a solid understanding of the mathematics behind various machine learning algorithms.
