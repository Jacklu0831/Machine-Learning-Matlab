# Machine Learning in Octave

A variety of ML algorithms from gradient descent to neural networks coded in Octave/Matlab with no fancy libraries. This allowed me to have a solid understanding of the mathematics behind those high level python libraries. My next step in breaking into AI is in the Deep-Learning-Projects repository.

As declared in the description, this collection of projects is mentored by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng through the Coursera Machine Learning . Thanks to his guidance, I got a solid understanding of the underlying logic that make ML algorithms work.

## Thank you Andrew Ng.
